# sql_ply
This was my third sem AFLL(Automata Formal Languages and Logic) mini project. So this projector tells whether the sql statement that we entered in the terminal is a valid or invalid statement. I have used select,truncate,drop,commit and rename sql constructs for my mini-project.


So for generating code for making constructs first we have install the ply module by typing the command "pip install ply" which installs the ply tool
I have used lex and yacc for my mini-project, where lex is used for tokenizing the string that we write and yacc is used for parsing purpose

$ python Assembler_v2.py <input_filename_with_extension>
